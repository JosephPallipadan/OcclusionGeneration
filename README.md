# Introduction

This is a repository that collates a few different projects that enable the generation of robust occlusion on faces.

Credit to :
* https://github.com/aqeelanwar/MaskTheFace for the Face Mask Generation, which was slightly modified to also output segmentation masks
* https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizGlassesVTOWidget for the sunglasses generation web-app on top of which a selenium script was written to capture images

Refer to the README in each folder for instructions on how to use.
